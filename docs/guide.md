# Annotation Tutor Lite — User Guide

This guide explains what each piece of Annotation Tutor Lite is, how it's created, and
why it helps. Everything described here is a plain-Markdown file in your Vault that any
agent can read — there is no hidden database.

## The learning loop (mental model)

```
annotate → agent review → distill a memory cell → cells auto-form scenes
   → the learner profile tracks you over time → the notebook is your readable output
   → spaced repetition brings cells back before you forget → repeat
```

Each arrow is a Markdown file written into `Agent Memory/`. You can read, edit, or delete
any of them by hand; the plugin reconciles and rebuilds its index from the files.

## Annotations

An **annotation** is the atom: a passage you highlighted plus what you think it means.

**How to create one:** select text in any note and run **Add learning annotation**
(`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L`), or use the editor right-click menu. Write your understanding in
the modal. The plugin:

- inserts an Obsidian block id (`^ann-YYYYMMDD-NNN`) at the source so the annotation stays
  anchored even as you edit around it, and
- writes `Agent Memory/annotations/ANN-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md` — the **source of truth** for that
  annotation (YAML frontmatter + Selected Text + your Note + the Agent Review + a Dialogue
  section). A link back to the source block sits at the top, so the file is one hop from
  the original text.

**The review:** run **Ask agent to review current annotation**. Your engine reads the
annotation, judges your understanding (correct / partially / incorrect), and writes an
**Agent Review** into the file. The plugin owns the metadata and your Note; the agent owns
the Agent Review / Review History — neither clobbers the other.

You can also chat with the tutor *inside* an annotation; turns are saved to the file's
`## Dialogue` section so the conversation survives reloads.

## Memory cells

A **memory cell** is an atomic, evidence-backed memory distilled from one or more
annotations. It is the unit your tutor remembers, schedules, and reviews. Each cell
(see `src/model.ts`) carries:

- a **concept** and a one-paragraph **summary**;
- a **type** — `understanding`, `misconception`, `goal`, `difficulty`, `strategy`, or
  `progress`;
- a **status** — e.g. `new`, `partially_understood`, `stable`, `needs_review`;
- a **confidence** (0–1) and the **source annotations** that back it; and
- a **spaced-repetition schedule** (see below) once it enters the review loop.

**How to create one:**

- **Manually** — place the cursor in an annotation and run **Create memory cell from
  current annotation**; or
- **Automatically** — when the agent finishes a review it can distill a durable cell for
  you.

Cells are stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter in `Agent Memory/memory-cells/`
(filenames are the cell id, e.g. `MEM-ann-20260606-001.md`; both `MEM-` and `CELL-`
prefixes are valid). The frontmatter is the source of truth.

## Spaced repetition (SM-2)

Cells are scheduled with the **SM-2 algorithm** (SuperMemo 2, Woźniak 1990 — the scheme
Anki and Mnemosyne use). SM-2 counters the **Ebbinghaus forgetting curve**: it expands the
gap between reviews each time you recall a cell, and collapses it when you don't, so you
review right before you'd forget. The implementation is `src/srs.ts`.

**How it works:** run **Review due cells**. For each due cell you reveal the answer, then
grade your recall:

| Button | Meaning | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Again** | forgot it | interval resets to 1 day, lapse counted, streak reset |
| **Hard** | barely | passes, ease nudged down |
| **Good** | recalled | interval steps 1d → 6d → `round(interval × ease)` |
| **Easy** | effortless | passes, ease nudged up, interval grows faster |

A brand-new cell is due immediately so it enters the loop; from there the schedule lives in
the cell's frontmatter (`ease`, `intervalDays`, `reps`, `lapses`, `dueAt`). Your measured
recall (reps/lapses) also feeds the strength/weakness analysis below — so the notebook's
judgments are grounded in behavior, not just the model's guess.

## Scenes

A **scene** is a context that groups related cells (a topic, course, document, or project).

**How scenes are triggered:** they form **automatically**. Whenever two or more cells
share the same concept, the plugin derives a scene for that concept (`deriveScenes` in
`src/memory-derive.ts`), tagged `auto`. This runs after you create a cell, after a review,
and on **Rebuild Annotation Tutor index** (via `store.syncScenesFromCells`). A single cell
needs no grouping, so it gets no scene until a second cell joins it.

Auto scenes are regenerated from the current cells, so stale ones are cleaned up
automatically. **Hand-authored scenes** (and agent-proposed scenes) are *not* tagged `auto`
and are left untouched — you can curate your own contexts alongside the automatic ones.

## The learner profile

The **learner profile** (`Agent Memory/profiles/learner-profile.md`) is an auditable,
plain-Markdown model of *you*: a short summary plus a list of **claims**, each a statement
backed by **evidence** (links to the annotations/cells that justify it). The tutor reads it
to personalize reviews and explanations to your strengths, gaps, and goals.

It starts empty and is maintained by the agent over time. `preferences.md` is a separate
profile for stated preferences; **agent writes to it are disabled by default** so the agent
can't silently rewrite your preferences.

## The notebook

The **notebook** turns your scattered annotations and cells into a study resource that
reads like a book — generated under `Agent Memory/Notebook/`:

- `Notebook.md` — the entry point / map of content;
- `pages/<doc>.md` — one "literature note" per studied document;
- `chapters/<topic>.md` — concept chapters grouping related pages;
- `Learning summary.md` — your **strengths**, **weaknesses**, and **problem-solving
  methods**.

**Why it helps:**

- **Navigable by design.** Entries are headed by a localized **date that links to the
  annotation**, and each annotation links back to its **source** — so you can travel
  notebook → annotation → original text in two clicks.
- **Real content without an agent pass.** Pages are generated deterministically from your
  annotations and cells, so the notebook is useful immediately; an optional agent pass adds
  prose.
- **Grounded summaries.** Strengths/weaknesses come from your actual review performance
  (reps/lapses), not guesses.
- **In your language.** Structure follows the plugin's display language; agent prose follows
  your review language.

**How to build it:** run **Build notebook** (deterministic) or **Enrich notebook with
agent** (adds synthesis prose). **Open study notebook** opens `Notebook.md`.

## Translation

For immersive reading in a foreign language:

- **Inline gloss** — select a word or passage and press **`Alt + T`** to insert a concise
  translation right after it. (Command: *Translate selection (inline gloss)*.)
- **Full-document pre-translation** — press **`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + T`** to gloss the whole
  document into a cached glossary so inline lookups are instant. (Command: *Pre-translate
  current document*.)
- **Pre-translate on open** — a setting that runs the full-document pre-translation
  automatically when you open a document. Its glossary feeds the inline `Alt+T` dictionary.
- **Dictionary language** — set your native language so foreign words are glossed as
  `word (译文)`; empty follows the display language.

## Memory write modes & proposals

Memory writes default to **`direct`**: the agent's cell/scene/profile changes are applied
immediately. Switch to **`confirmation`** in settings to route every proposed change through
the **Proposals** tab, where you approve or reject each one (queued under
`Agent Memory/proposals/pending/`, archived after). Use this when you want a human gate on
what enters your long-term memory.

## Keyboard shortcuts
